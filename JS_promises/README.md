### Promises

A promises Object in JavaScript:

- Promise to return a value
- Wrap asynchronous code
- Will be PENDING before getting:
  - RESOLVED: If the task returns succesfully (ex.: file fetched succesfully)
  - REJECTED: Is the task fails for come reason (ex.: unfetched file)

For this example would use 3 tasks to get done in order:

1. Walk the Dog
2. Clean the Kitchen
3. Take out the trash

In this section I went over a couple of scenarios were promises could be used. Here are the list of how these scenarios were placed in this folder.

1. Promises_1.js: is met to reflect the use of a callback hell is promises are not being used.
